CasualTravel is an exciting app that allows users to register and take a unique survey to discover their interests. After that, they are faced with an interactive map of the city in which they are, with the most interesting sights of the city highlighted for them.

Users have the freedom to choose the places they want to visit and the ability to generate a route on their own directly on the map, which will be visually presented for convenience.

In addition, they can choose the function "automatically generate a route", where a smart algorithm will analyze their interests and information about local attractions, suggesting the most optimal route for an unforgettable discovery of the city.
